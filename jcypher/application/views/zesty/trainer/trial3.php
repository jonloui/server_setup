					<li>This will be their final driving trial.  Use the stopwatch on your phone and make sure they finish the pickup within 15 mins and also the setup within 15 mins.</li>
					<li>Do not tell trialist unless they begin loading items.  The set purposely will be missing a tray for the buns and a tray for the salad.  Give them a tray for buns and a tray for the salad from the Trial 1 set.</li>
					<li>The client will have a nut allergy, make sure the trialist asks you what to do with the side of nuts for the salad. Let them know they should contact support so they can advise what to do in this situation.  Some clients have a severe allergy where they can't be in the same room, in this case leave nuts at the restaurant.  Other clients are ok with nuts as long as it's clearly labeled.</li>
					<li>*** Please make sure to return the bun and salad trays to the Trial 1 set when you finish. ***</li>

					<li>Make sure they ask for the missing tray of buns and salad after they go through the checklist.  Sometimes the restaurant staff will forget to hand-off certain items.</li>
