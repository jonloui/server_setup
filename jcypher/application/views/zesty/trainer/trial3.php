					<li>This will be their final driving trial.  Use the stopwatch on your phone and make sure they finish the pickup within 10 mins and also the setup within 10 mins.</li>
					<li>Do not tell trialist unless they begin loading items.  The set purposely will be missing a tray for the buns and a tray for the salad.  Give them a tray for buns and a tray for the salad from the Trial 1 set.</li>
					<li>The client will have a nut allergy, make sure the trialist asks you what to do with the side of nuts for the salad. Some clients have a severe allergy where they can't be in the same room, in this case leave nuts at the restaurant.  Other clients are ok with nuts as long as it's clearly labeled.</li>
					<li>*** Please make sure to return these trays to the Trial 1 set when you finish. ***</li>
